        Dandruff is a common scalp condition characterized by flaking of the skin, often accompanied by itching and irritation. It occurs due to factors like dry skin, fungal infections, or sensitivity to hair care products. While not harmful, dandruff can be bothersome and is manageable with proper hygiene, medicated shampoos, and maintaining a healthy scalp environment.
