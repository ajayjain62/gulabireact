        Anti-anemic agents are substances or medications used to prevent or treat anemia, a condition characterized by low red blood cell count or hemoglobin levels. These agents, such as iron supplements, folic acid, vitamin B12, or erythropoiesis-stimulating drugs, work to restore red blood cell production, improve oxygen transport, and alleviate symptoms like fatigue, weakness, and dizziness caused by anemia.
