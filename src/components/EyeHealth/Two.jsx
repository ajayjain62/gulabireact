          Eye health is essential for maintaining clear vision and overall well-being. Proper eye care involves protecting eyes from excessive screen time, wearing sunglasses to block harmful UV rays, and consuming a diet rich in vitamins A, C, and E. Regular eye exams help detect and prevent conditions like glaucoma, cataracts, and macular degeneration, ensuring long-term visual health.
