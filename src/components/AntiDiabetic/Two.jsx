They work through various mechanisms, such as increasing insulin sensitivity, stimulating insulin production, or reducing glucose absorption. Common types include metformin, insulin, and sulfonylureas. Combined with a healthy diet and lifestyle, these medications play a crucial role in diabetes management and preventing complications.
