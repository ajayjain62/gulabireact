          Weight loss is the process of reducing body weight by burning more calories than consumed. It typically involves a combination of healthy eating, regular physical activity, and lifestyle changes. Effective weight loss focuses on sustainable habits rather than quick fixes, aiming to improve overall health, boost energy levels, and reduce the risk of chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease.
