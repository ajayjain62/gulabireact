        Collagen supplements are a popular health product designed to support skin elasticity, joint health, and overall well-being. Collagen, a vital protein in the body, diminishes with age, leading to wrinkles, weaker joints, and reduced flexibility. These supplements, often available in powder, capsule, or liquid form, help replenish collagen levels, promoting youthful skin, stronger hair, and improved mobility.
