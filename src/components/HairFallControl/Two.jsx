          Hair fall control involves adopting a comprehensive approach that includes proper hair care, a balanced diet, and maintaining overall health. Regular cleansing with mild shampoos, conditioning, and gentle scalp massages can improve blood circulation. Additionally, using natural oils, managing stress, and avoiding excessive heat treatments can help strengthen hair roots, reduce breakage, and promote healthy hair growth.
