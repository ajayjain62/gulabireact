        Body detox is a natural or guided process of eliminating toxins from the body to improve overall health and wellness. It typically involves lifestyle changes such as consuming nutrient-rich foods, staying hydrated, and engaging in physical activity. Detoxification supports liver function, boosts energy, and promotes clearer skin, aiding the body's natural ability to cleanse and rejuvenate itself.
