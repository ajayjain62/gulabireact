        Antioxidants are compounds that protect the body from damage caused by harmful molecules called free radicals. Found in fruits, vegetables, and other natural sources, they help prevent oxidative stress, which can lead to chronic diseases and aging. Key antioxidants include vitamins C and E, beta-carotene, and selenium, promoting better health and supporting the immune system.
