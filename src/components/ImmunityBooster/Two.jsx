          Immunity boosters are substances that help strengthen the body's natural defense system, making it more resilient against infections and diseases. These can include vitamins, minerals, herbs, and natural foods like citrus fruits, ginger, garlic, and leafy greens. Regular intake of immunity-boosting elements can help enhance overall health, improve recovery times, and reduce the risk of chronic illnesses.
